                    <h3>Research, Scholarship and Professional Growth Project</h3>
                    <p>
                        The RSPG application was a group project for my CS 4760 Capstone class. This project involved many different skills
                        and programming languages to complete. We used Razor Pages .Net Framework to complete this project which involved
                        HTML, css, C#, and a MySQL database to store all of our data involved in the system. I was involved in database
                        handling, model creation and maintaining, page functionality and creation, file submission and downloadability,
                        user password encryption, and unit test creation. This project is also being considered by Weber State University
                        to implement as their RSPG page for eWeber with the functionality and design we created. To complete this project
                        we used the Agile Development Model with weekly Sprint Meetings.

                    <p>
                        The LMS application was a group project for my CS 3750 Software Engineering 2 class. This project was created with
                        Razor Pages .Net Framework with use of HTML, css, C#, and MySQL database to store the data for our application. I
                        was involved in model creation and maintaining, page functionality and creation, file submission and downloadability,
                        Unit Tests, and UI design. To complete this project we used the Agile Development Model with weekly Sprint Meetings.
