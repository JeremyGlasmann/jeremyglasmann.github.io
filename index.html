        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            I’m a Computer Science major graduating in Spring 2025 with a passion for building applications and solving
            complex problems through object-oriented programming. During my time in school, I’ve worked on a wide range of
            individual and group projects, collaborating with peers to design, develop, and deploy functional applications.
            These group projects have helped me strengthen my communication and teamwork skills, while also gaining 
            real-world experience working in collaborative development environments. I’ve built software using C++, C#, 
            Python, PowerShell, Bash, and .NET with Razor Pages. This portfolio showcases the work I’ve done and the skills 
            I’ve gained along the way.
