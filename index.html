                    <p>
                        I'm a Computer Science major graduating in Spring 2025 with a passion for building applications and solving
                        complex problems through object-oriented programming. During my time in school, I've worked on a wide range of
                        individual and group projects, collaborating with peers to design, develop, and deploy functional applications.
                        These group projects have helped me strengthen my communication and teamwork skills, while also gaining
                        real-world experience working in collaborative development environments. I've built software using C++, C#,
                        Python, PowerShell, Bash, and .NET with Razor Pages. This portfolio showcases the work I've done and the skills
                        I've gained along the way.
