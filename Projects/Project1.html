                    <p>
                        The RSPG application involved creating an extrensive system for our Capstone project with the Razor Pages
                        .Net Framework. It allows the user to login if they already have a profile or register with a new one.
                        This was all linked to a database that would update when new things were created or edited along the way.
                        This is what the register page looks like when registering a new user. The password also got encrypted
                        after submission which I personally implemented.
                    </p>
                    <p>Registration Page</p>

                         class="img-thumbnail rounded shadow mb-4" style="max-width: 600px;">
                    <p>
                        After logging in the user is welcomed with a dashboard with many different things they could do with our
                        application. Depending on the status of the logged in user, whether they were an RSPG member, a Department
                        chair, or a School Dean, that would also change the navbar and what the user could do. They can also see
                        their unsubmitted, submitted, pending, approved, and declined RSPG Applications on the Dashboard.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        All logged in users can submit a RSPG Grant Application. The form is to be fully filled out, it has drop
                        down menus, allows the user to upload files with their submission, and specify financial requests. If they
                        want to they can also save that application to be completed later.

                    <p>
                        If a department chair was logged in then they could go to the Approve/Reject RSPG Forms tab and look through
                        the details of the submitted form, this page also allows the user to download the submitted files linked to
                        it, and then afterwards Accept or Reject that form, where it would then be checked as ChairApproved and
                        that allowed the form to be rated.
                    </p>
                    <p>Approval Page</p>

                    <p>
                        The Review Applications tab was accessable by all types of users so they could rate submitted and department
                        chair approved RSPG forms. You can see project info, requested amount of money, and total rating that the
                        current user has submitted for that application. Upon clicking rate they see a projects details page and a
                        link to the RSPG Rubric for rating the submission.

                    <p>
                        The user would then fill out the rubric, calculate the total score, and then rate the submitted application.
                    </p>
                    <p>Rubric Page</p>

                    <p>
                        The RSPG Chair has the abolity to Allocate funds to these submitted RSPG Grant Applications. On this page
                        it lists all the submitted projects with their Average rating and requested funds. The Chair can then fill
                        the total funds and maximum funds per project. This page then allows them to allocate all the funds based
                        on their average rating, and change the percent of requested funds give. After that is completed they can
                        submit the Allocated data to accounting with a CSV file and click done afterwards to finish up
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Finally, the users who have been approved for an RSPG Grant have to submit a RSPG Summary Final Report
                        after a certain amount of time or after completing their proposed project to show what they did.
